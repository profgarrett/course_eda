# Modeling to predict the future

Our prior course focused on visualizations as a means to understand. This course builds on that concept, but mainly focuses on creating models. A model is a simplified version of the real-world, expressed in mathematical terms.

We have several key challenges:

- Simplicity: we want models that are concise with the fewest possible fields
- Measurement: all measurement is flawed, but we need to capture the right amount of detail
- Error: all models are limited, so we need standard ways of capturing error.

# What is Machine Learning?

See [a visual guide](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)

Outcomes:

- Definitions of a feature, split point, recursion, and overfitting
- Describe a scatterplot, decision tree, histogram,
- Measure accuracy
- Differentiate between training and test data
