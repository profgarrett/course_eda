# Introduction

This section introduces you to getting your local computer setup.

If you've taken an R class before, I highly recommend uninstalling both R and RStudio before starting the below instructions.

## Installing R



- Install R: https://cran.rstudio.com/
  - Install R Studio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Configure R
  - Go to Tools / Global Options and set General / Basic options
    -  Disable *restore most recently opened project at startup*
    -  Disable *Restore .RData into Workspace on startup*
    -  Set *Save Workspace to .RData on exit* to never
    -  Disable *Always save history*
  - Set Code / Diagnostics
    -  Turn on all diagnostics except *warn if variable used has no definition in scope*
  - Show markers
    - Go to *View / *Show Other Panes* / *Show Markers*
  - lintr
    - For more specific style guides, install lintr
    - Go to  Tools > addins > Browse Addins > Keyboard Shortcuts and set the Control + Shift + L keyboard shortcut
    - Note that you have to save the file before running the linter. 



## Overall RStudio Layout

- RStudio features
  - Console for interactive input
  - Script editor for saving (be sure to re-run)
  - Shortcuts: control+enter to run the current line, or all selected.
- Files Management
  - It's really critical to properly store and name your files
  - Create a folder for our class, and a new folder for *every* project. For now, you don't need a project file, but once we start using datafiles it'll be really important.


## Style Guide

- Save your main code file as MainYourname.R (for example, MainNathanGarrett.R).
- Link with *Control Shift L* 
- Do not depend on program state or .RData files! I must be able to run your code as it is submitted in the R file. I strongly suggest closing and re-opening R, and then running all of the code to make sure it works properly.


## Shortcuts

There are several vital shortcuts:

- *alt -* for `<-` 
- *control s* for saving 
- *control shift l* for linter (always save first!)
- *control enter* to run the current line or highlighted section
