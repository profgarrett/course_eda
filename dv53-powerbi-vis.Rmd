A bookmark is used to save the state of a page. Define a bookmark, and then assign buttons to switch between different bookmarks.

- Go to view and turn on both "Bookmarks" and "Selection"
- Repeat for each view of your data:
  - Hide/show charts
  - Create a bookmark 
- Create a button and assign it to activate the correct bookmark
  - Note that the text of the button is under Format / Style / Text
  - Control-click to activate the button

## Process for going to another page

You can also use bookmarks to navigate between pages.

- Create your pages
- Add a blank button
- Go to the button action, pick Page Navigation, and select the correct destination page.


# Custom Tooltip
