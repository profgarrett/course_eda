# Tableau Software

See Datacamp *Introduction to Tableau*

## Installation

Before class, install Tableau on your computer:

- Download the [latest version of Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/tft/activation)
- Click on the link above and select “Download Tableau Desktop”. On the form, enter your school email address for Business E-mail and enter the name of your school for Organization.
- Activate with your product key:  *See eCampus for key*
- Already have a copy of Tableau Desktop installed? Update your license in the application: Help menu → Manage Product Keys. Make sure that you are fully up to date with the latest version.

## Interface

- Data pane for looking at data
- Sheets/pages
- Canvas for your vis
- Filters to limit (either upper-left or right panel)
- Mark cards are used to change how data is displayed
- Buttons
  - Undo/Back 
  - *Show me* button
  - Clear sheet
- Control+click to copy

## Saving

Be careful how you save your file! Normal Tableau files don't include the data. You must save as a *packaged workbook* for any submitted work in this class.

We share our data with Tableau Public *and* our private Tableau group. 

# Getting data

- Connect to Excel or flat file (csv)
  - Excel: multiple-sheets + formatting
  - CSV: comma-separated-values, no format or sheets.
- Rename fields
- Change datatype of a field

We can create a calculated field in Tableau, similar to an Excel function.

- Arithmetic (PEMDAS)
- ROUND function
- Ratios with one value divided by another

## Terms

- Data types
  - `Text`
  - `Integers` are number without a decimal point value
  - `Floats`/`doubles` include information past the decimal point
  - `Money` is a type in some databases. It is an integer that records the number of pennies, which solves some problems with doubles/floats
  - `Boolean` are True or False values
  - `Dates`
    - Dates can be either discrete or continuous. While they default to continuous, this may not look like you want. 
    - You can pick if you want slices (like Months) containing a year or being independent. If you want just the month, make the pill blue (discrete). If you want the month and the year, then make the pill green (continuous).
- Dimensions
  - `Discrete` / blue pills are discrete categories (like Id number, neighborhood)
  - `Continuous` / green pills are continuous ranges (like room price)
- Measures
  - Functions applied to data
  - `Count`, `sum`, `max`, `min`, etc...
  - Average can have multiple meanings
    - `Mode` is the most common item
    - `Mean` is sum / count
    - `Median` is middle item when sorted large/small
  - Can be applied to continuous (like average price) or discrete (like count)
  - We commonly use discrete measures and continuous dimensions.

# Chart Types

- Heat Map / Table:
  - Color by measure
  - Sort by value or title
- Bar:
  - Sort by name or data
  - Color by dimension or measure
- Histogram
  - Set a custom bin size
- Scatterplot
  - Show either aggregated or disaggregated data
  - Use color, size, x, and y
  - Trend lines, reference lines
  - Use custom scale
- Boxplot
  - Good for showing data range by dimension
- Line chart
  - Used only for date data
  - Custom date scale
- Combo chart
  - Used for multiple scales, usually time + something else
  - Create by dragging/dropping, or right-click the pill and choose `Dual Axis`
  - Know how to synchronize left and right scales
- Map
  - Filled map
  - Symbol / dot map
    - Understand why you don't want to use size for negative numbers
  - Understand the data type for geography data! This includes zip, city, state, longitude/latitude etc..

## Formatting

Add the following lines by going to Analytics, and picking the appropriate option

- Reference lines
- Trend lines
- Forecasting

Tooltip

- Add fields to a tooltip
- Know how to edit the text and formatting


# Filter / Sorting


Levels (from earlier to latest)

- Extraction filters 
- Data source
- Context
- Dimension
- Measure

Add a filter by:

- Right-clicking on a cell and clicking show only or exclude.
- Adding a field to the filter pane

Filter options:

- TOP 
- Non-null
- Show as (right-click)
  - Single value (dropdown, list, slider)
  - Multiple values (list, dropdown, custom list, wildcard)
  - Show as floating

Sort

- Use sort button on button bar to sort by values
- Use a-z button on chart to sort by a field name

Use Pages for a different style of filter

# Dashboards / Stories

- Dashboards
  - Contain multiple sheets on a single page
  - Format with titles, and font
  - Add a filter
    - On the right, floating, or by clicking on a chart
- Stories
  - Contain multiple sheets on multiple pages
