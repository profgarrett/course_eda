# Syntax in R
This file is an overview of the syntax in R.
It provides a basic introduction to the major features.


## R Grammar Rules

R is case sensitive!

Note the grammar rules of R:

- Variables: single word
  - Starts with a letter
  - No spaces
  - Special characters . _ are ok, but we prefer _ (underscore)
  - Suggest lower case and snake_case (not CamelCase or camel.case)
- Functions: word with parenthesis() immediately following. 
- Numbers: no punctuation!
- Text: wrap words with "a" or 'a'
- Type: find the type of a variable with class(x)


Comments: 

- start each line with a #


Logical:

- Use === for equality test, and <- for assignment


Data types:

- Basic
  - numeric: all numbers by default, esp 1.0
  - integer: number with L at the end, i.e., class(1L)
  - character: 'a' or "a" (prefer "double")
  - logical: T/F or TRUE/FALSE (not True or "TRUE" or "True")
  - factor: essentially an enum
- Vector: 
  - This is an array type
  - Create as c(1, 2,3)
  - Access numeric elements with 1-based index
    - name_of_vector[1]
    - vec[1:3]
    - vec[length(vec)] 
- Data.frame: 
  - Older, we will use tupples instead
  - Useful functions include rownames, colnames, names, nrow, ncol
  - Other, summary, str
  - We will access named items as data$item_name
- Matrix: rectangular items, ie. example[x, y]

Yarr is a gentle introduction to using R.
If you haven't done any programming before, this could be
a good way to get started.

W3 Schools has a nice reference for R code. This is really
good for trying to lookup a specific feature.
