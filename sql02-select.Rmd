## Outcomes:

This module will teach you how to write basic SELECT FROM queries.

- SELECT single fields, *, and "multi word title" as new_title
    - DISTINCT
- FROM table
- WHERE field 
    - Use the comparisons >, >=, <, <=, =, != 
    - Match a number (1) or "string value" or NULL
    - Use AND/OR
- Understand the role of capitalization
- Sort the returned values





### Reference Code

Get all information from the categories table.

> SELECT * FROM categories


Get some fields. Use "double quote" for fields with a space in
their name.

> SELECT CategoryID, "CategoryName", Description FROM categories


Rename a field or table with AS

> SELECT CategoryID AS "Primary Key" FROM categories AS c1


Limit rows returned with WHERE. 

> SELECT * FROM categories WHERE CategoryID > 2


Test for text by wrapping your values in 'single quotes'

> SELECT * FROM categories WHERE CategoryName = "main"


Text with multiple conditions with AND / OR

> SELECT * FROM categories WHERE CategoryID <= 2 OR CategoryID >= 4


Test for text comparisons with LIKE and wildcards

> SELECT * FROM CategoryName WHERE CategoryName LIKE 'E%'


Set the order of the fields returned (ascending / descending)

> SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY FirstName DESC, LastName ASC

See only unique records with DISTINCT

> SELECT DISTINCT CategoryName FROM Categories 


## Detailed Explanation

Using SQL SELECT allows you to retrieve data from a database. The SELECT statement is one of the fundamental and most commonly used SQL commands. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to use SQL SELECT:

1. Syntax: The basic syntax of the SELECT statement is as follows:

> SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE conditions ORDER BY column1, ...;

2. Columns to retrieve: Specify the columns you want to retrieve data from after the SELECT keyword. You can list multiple column names separated by commas, or use `*` to select all columns.

3. Table to retrieve data from: After the FROM keyword, specify the name of the table from which you want to retrieve the data.

4. Filtering (Optional): You can use the WHERE clause to add conditions to filter the data. This allows you to retrieve only the rows that meet specific criteria. For example:

> SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

5. Order By allows you to sort your results. List you fields, just as in the Select 
statement. They default to ascending (a-z), but you can also have them 
in descending order by adding desc after the column name, i.e. "... ORDER BY column1 desc;"

> SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition ORDER BY column1;

6. Fetching data: Once you have constructed the SELECT statement, execute it against the database using an appropriate SQL client or programming language with SQL support (e.g., Python with a database connector).

Examples:
- To retrieve all columns from a table named "employees":

> SELECT * FROM employees;

- To retrieve specific columns (e.g., name and age) from the "employees" table:

>  SELECT name, age FROM employees;
 
- To retrieve data based on specific conditions, such as fetching employees with a salary greater than 50000:

>SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

- You can use various SQL functions and operators within the SELECT statement to perform calculations or transformations on the retrieved data.

Remember to use semicolons to terminate your SQL statements, as it is a common convention in SQL to signify the end of a command.
